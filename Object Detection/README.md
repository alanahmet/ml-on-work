There are a lot of model for object detection.One-shot object detection very fast and allow live detection with resonable computational resorces most famous example is   [yolo](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7) which is well train and easy to use. [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md) have
bunch of different model pre-train on coco dataset and [detectron](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron) use rcnn and can pick for custom object detection.
